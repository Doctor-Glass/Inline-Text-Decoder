# Inline Text Decoder

This is a basic little utility that I created for a software interview. It takes in the URL of a Google Docs document and extracts a table in a standard format with characters and their respective X and Y coordinates, then puts them together and outputs them to the standard output. This can be used to decode messages saved to a Google Docs document in a standard format.
